Udacity Project Create A Memory Match Game

Project Rubric: 

**Game Behavior**

| Criteria      | Meets Specs  | 
| ------------- |:-------------:|
| Memory Game Logic     | The game randomly shuffles the cards. A user wins once all cards have successfully been matched.| 
| Congratulations Popup    | When a user wins the game, a modal appears to congratulate the player and ask if they want to play again. It should also tell the user how much time it took to win the game, and what the star rating was.    |
| Restart Button | A restart button allows the player to reset the game board, the timer, and the star rating.     |
| Star Rating | The game displays a star rating (from 1-3) that reflects the player's performance. At the beginning of a game, it should display 3 stars. After some number of moves, it should change to a 2 star rating. After a few more moves, it should change to a 1 star rating. The number of moves needed to change the rating is up to you, but it should happen at some point.     |
| Timer | When the player starts a game, a displayed timer should also start. Once the player wins the game, the timer stops.     |
| Move Counter | Game displays the current number of moves a user has made.    |

**Suggestions to Make Your Project Stand Out!**


-Add CSS animations when cards are clicked, unsuccessfully matched, and successfully matched.
-Add unique functionality beyond the minimum requirements (Implement a leaderboard, store game state using local storage, etc.)
-Implement additional optimizations that improve the performance and user experience of the game (keyboard shortcuts for gameplay, etc).
